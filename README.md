# üêæ Dog Breed Classification with CNNs üêï

This repository contains a jupyter notebook for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify dog breeds. The project aims to accurately categorize different dog breeds using a mobileNet CNN algorithm.

## Contents:
- **dog_breed_classification.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook for building and training the CNN model.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/dog-breed-classification.git`
2. Download Kaggle Dog Breed Identification competition data: [Download here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Follow the dog_breed_classification.ipynb script to train and evaluate the model.
